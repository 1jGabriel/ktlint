# Contributing Guidelines

- If you have an idea/suggestion, bug report or anything you think might be of interest - don't be shy, 
[create a ticket](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/issues/new). No idea is bad, no opinion is wrong. 
- If you see a typo, misbehaving rule or something simply out of place - send a PR (FYI: repo containing [ktlint.github.io](https://ktlint.github.io) sources is [here](https://github.com/ktlint/ktlint.github.io)). 
I try to merge fixes within 24h.
- If you are thinking of introducing a [rule to the core](ktlint-ruleset-standard/src/main/kotlin/com/github/shyiko/ktlint/ruleset/standard) - please
[file an issue](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/issues/new) first. As soon as it gets a <img width="144" height="23" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/370176/26526290/b0170078-432a-11e7-847e-c99c169cbb3f.png"> tag - you can start working on it knowing that it will be merged in.
